Project Proposal

Project summary:

Have an interface that could inform students of the amount and a type of material to add to optimize composting conditions. In addition, it could be nice for this interface to inform students when they should turn compost so it can maintain the optimal 50-60 C temperature

Problem description:

For compost to process material most efficiently, it must have the correct ratio of greens to browns (carbon to nitrogen) and be within the correct temperature. Although it is possible to measure the amount of carbon and nitrogen in certain compounds, it is not feasible to do this are the numbers are often tabulated to an order of magnitude.

Stakeholders:
ESW/MOSS

Solution:

MVP:
HTML web page that performs the basic functionality

Architectural Model:

![Architectural Model](/Architecture.png?raw=true)

Functionality:

· Be able to log in and view your different “Compost Profiles”
· View status of current composts
· Input what food you add the the compost
· Calculate the ratios of different chemicals
· Notify the user when to turn the compost
· Give a time estimate on how long till the compost will be done
· Add or delete compost profiles

For each profile:

· View temp
· Add more items

Timeline:

Potential problems:

Composters/users might not give enough information to create a graph
We don’t have the equation to calculate the ratios (waiting to get this from Zach)
